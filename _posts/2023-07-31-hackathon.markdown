ðŸŒ®  The team won 3rd place! I participated in a Google I/O Extended Hackathon hosted by the Google Developer Groups of Central Florida. ðŸ¥‘ 



It was fun, exciting, and challenging to hack away and develop a proof concept idea that works. We dove deep into integrating machine learning AI tools into web and mobile applications. In this project, we created two different applications one was an iOS app, and the other was a Web application. 



The idea was to generate recipes by simply snapping a picture of the ingredients in your refrigerator. The AI segmentation will detect ingredients and send that to Google AIs machine learning tool to generate recipes. We ran short of time; I got the iOS app partially completed but was able to get the computer vision and AI tools running on the Django Web application. The goal is to continue working on this project and get this out to the public so we can help others find creative ways to cook the best recipes.
